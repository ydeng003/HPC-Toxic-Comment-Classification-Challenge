83b52de9d6866ce3,":This issue has been dealt with. But, suffice it to say, the interest of wikipedia is to present the truth (the theory being that enough contributors can arrive at the truth through consensus). If something is objectively true, and yet is disputed (for example, the existence of the Holocaust), then it is not the job of wikipedia to pretend that there is some conflict as to the realities of history. When there was a dispute about a factual matter, and that dispute has been resolved (as is the case here), there is no need whatsoever to pretend that the matters that were the subject of the dispute are still in controversy.  Here we have the latter case: Nobody today contends that Chassidim are lax on halacha, etc. And, indeed, nobody contends today that Chassidim were lax in halacha at any time in history.  Quite the opposite, in fact. Those attacks have been universally recognized as false.  To pretend, for the sake of NPOV, that the untruth of the aforementioned attacks is in question is foolish.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

For someone to actually believe that a denomination would be much better if a church exercised total control over its members is frightening.  The situations you mention such as members owning televisions, sisters cutting their hair and wearing pants also make my case.  These 'sins' (in the eyes of old order ACCA) have deeply divided the church.  The fact these acts are even considered to be sinful speak volumes to the erroneous beliefs of the ACCA. Other 'sins' include sports (participation and as a spectator), movies (even G-rated), attending another church (my parents would not even attend their grandsons' graduation recognitions), and wearing jewelry.  Some are still clinging to these beliefs to the point where the elder of the Lamar, Missouri church would not allow the youth there to congregate with youth from certain other ACCA churches because he believed they would be led astray.  I have attended a number of churches of other denominations.  At each church I was warmly welcomed and invited to worship as I saw fit.  What a contrast this was in comparison to growing up in the ACCA.  All I heard was what was not allowed and straying from the teachings of the church leadership would lead to an eternity in hell.  The good news is the ACCA is losing membership in droves as their extremist views are challenged by members willing to read the bible and make decisions regarding their salvation on their own instead of relying on the flawed teachings of man.

Also, citations were not in proper format.    == Other modern Modifications of Kondratieff theory ==    === The contest of Political Long Cycles vs. Economic Long Cycles ===    The theory of long cycles tend to generate much debate during periods of so-called """"recessions"""", while during the long periods of growth decreases instead the intensity of the debate. Since the 1970s and above 1980s, the discussions increased quite hugely, when they were relatively faded between 1945 and 1970. It is questionable whether the period since 1967 (Meadows Report), or 1971 (end of gold convertibility of the dollar) or 1973 (oil shocks) is a long recession. The US economy has experienced strong productivity gains and a period of economic growth in length as yet unknown, from the years 1980s. As for Asia, this continent started to take off ever since. But Europe has actually experienced the problems of mass unemployment and slower growth since the 1970s. Yet the theory of long cycles then experienced an upturn, but in all over directions than before. These long cycles would be not economic, but also political. It is not only cycles of political views, but cycles involving the world via their geopolitical dimension. And Modelski (1983) and Goldstein (1988) are interpreting and completing the Kondratiev results. In parallel with Kondratiev economic long waves, exist in parallel hegemonic cycles. Hegemonic cycle lasts two successive Kondratiev cycles (120 years) by Modelski, or between two and three cycles (150 years) by Goldstein.    === Neo-Schumpeterian Approaches vs. World System Approaches ===    In fact, in Europe itself, the theory of hegemonic long cycles initiated notably by Modelski and Goldstein, has long had less success in starting a debate in Universities, than the theories about economic long cycles lasting approximately 50 years. The real debate has often opposed rather - since the 1970s and especially 1980s - neo-Schumpeterian on one hand, with advocates of the theory of the World System on the other hand. It is true though that the World System Approach accepts more the idea of a possible existence of political long cycles. Among the neo-Schumpeterian, Kleinknecht conducted audits of the econometric theory of Kondratiev, country by country, and concludes we can consider this theory as widely tested empirically. On the other hand, proponents of the theory of the World System note that this theory does not oppose only developed countries on one hand, developing countries on the other side. It is also showed, in developed countries themselves, the presence of growing inequalities in income and endowment factors, between neighboring regions: through the establishment of systems for the construction of suitable qualifications, the long cycle and the global system naturally spread inequalities locally, according to the international division of labor. Gerhard Mensch's works can be proved to be in part as a link between these theories. On the one hand he argues for a neo-Schumpeterian explanation of the long cycles of innovation. On the other hand, since it explains that innovations through credit systems adapted to recognize the global evolution, may exist in periods of expansion like in recession periods, it justifies the fact that innovations can be supported by the public sector, for example in a recession and to increase the average skill level.    === Methodological Enquiries ===    Assume that the findings made in the early days of the theory of economic long cycles (early twentieth century and even a little before) show points of support to build statistical systems, that are conceived in order to verify the theory. What are these points of support? On the one hand, the various economic sectors vehicle some productivity differentials. Thanks to the knowledge of these differentials... we could understand how the credit spreads from a sector of the economy to another to feed growth. But if we reason, not taking into account the sectoral point of view, but rather from a national perspective, we will not have that subtelty. It is this subtelty that allows the construction of econometric systems to resolve the question. If we can understand the phenomenon of growth only nationally is one possibility; there economy and law are used to walk closely together. But it must go global to move towards the solution in terms of the method how to conceptually integrate the global innovation? Should it be, to hope to achieve, and solve, again... a question of method! Indeed, early theories of long cycles rather studied the issue of price changes for each country, and also in some respects suggested modest ways to incorporate the issue of quantity or income. Now if we come to the world",0,0,0,0,0,0
ea586eef1fdbe1d3,"""    The new intro is a nice improvement. I agree with Melcombe about scope (and much else). Some issues I think could be cleared up   * Saying non-parametric means """"very few"""" assumptions seems to vague; one could say that assuming a classical linear model is just one assumption. I appreciate that it looks very abstract, but the finite-dimensional restriction is in van der Vaart and Cox [Prinicples book] - and probably lots of other places too. Perhaps a little more in the way of examples would help?   * Simple random sampling is an assumption that can be made in fully- semi- and non-parametric models. So it's perhaps not best to state it as the sole example in the non-parametric bullet.   * The randomization-based models section should start with something to orient the reader. For example, """"An important experimental situation where strong assumptions are well-motivated is the randomized study"""". Then say how inference proceeds. Then compare randomization-based inference to other approaches.   * """"warrants"""" is nowhere near the right word.   * False models and pi=22/7 is a bizarre comparison. Anyone can see 22/7 is not Pi. It would be an overstatement to ridicule assuming classical linear models because they're not true. (n.b. I would rather not include the Box mantra on models and usefulness, it's hackneyed and quoted as support by people with very different stances)   * Information and computational complexity - doesn't mention inference anywhere, so not obviously relevant   * Fiducial/Lindley - Lindley (1958) didn't show fiducial inference """"fails"""", he showed that it didn't correspond to a Bayesian procedure - this isn't quite the same.

As per WP:POPCULTURE, secondary sources are preferable to establish the significance of the reference as being worthy for inclusion in the article: However, passing mentions in books, television or film dialogue, or song lyrics should be included only when that mention's significance is itself demonstrated with secondary sources. I did a similar section on the Don't Look Now article, and found film reviews or interviews with the director to be the best secondary sources for establishing the importance of these cultural references. The main thing there though, was that I tried as much as possible to avoid citing the referring film itself. For example, for the """"Stallone as the Terminator"""" reference in Last Action Hero, this secondary source would be better, since it establishes the notability of the film reference and thereby places it into a cultural context. I don't think this issue should be a block to a GA though, it's just an area that could be improved IMO.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I had assumed WorkerBee74 had read some of those articles he found in Nexis. They fall into two categories: 1) Editorials and opinion pieces claiming  largely without evidence  that there was some kind of non-professional connection. 2) News stories about those claims.

This policy makes a strong case that the possible """"bias"""" of the editor's additions to the Kevin Hart article should stand.  Any editor who finds bias has the burden of adding material to balance this perceived bias.  Hesperian and others need to stand down and either leave the article on Hart alone or add documented and relevant material of their own.    Let me add that Hesperian has continued to accuse me of sock-puppetry (note that his/her diatribe begins """"I don't know what Hart did to piss this person off""""), which is a ridiculous delusion.  There have been at least four editors that have been involved in the development of this piece.  I restored edits made by another editor because I agreed with that him/her that the article is valid and informed.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by        == Stubbing and semi-protection an abuse of authority ==    Hesperian semi-protected and stubbed this article after someone posted Hart's own published comments on a fellow Australian poet. I cannot fathom how removing this material is a gesture of neutrality. Now the article is left with bits of praise, with no real sense of who Hart is. That's what is missing now. Who Hart really is, and how the academic community perceives him, is the basis for an excellent article. Was the piece excellent before Hesperian stubbed it? No, but we were all working on getting it there, and at least it was informative (until Hesperian stubbed it), and anyone who felt the piece lacked balance was free to add strong and positive reviews of Hart's work. Hesperian has deleted well-researched, accurately documented, informative material about Hart, material that was not available anywhere else on the web. Significantly, it was material that was submitted by several editors, not just one.  (Moreover, Hesperian has continued to make accusations of sock-puppetry, which is a ridiculous delusion. There have been at least four editors that have been involved in the development of this piece. I restored edits made by another editor because I agreed with that him/her that the article is valid and informed.)  Hesperian's stub amounts to a hatchet job on what was growing slowly into a well-rounded and important analysis of a highly successful poet and critic. Such an article needs both positive and negative reviews if it is to have any validity at all. Some of that material might not flatter Kevin Hart, but so what? Is it Wikipedia's purpose to flatter? If so, it has no reliability. Please bear in mind that all deleted material was well-documented and was originally published in scholarly, peer-reviewed presses. In my view, Hesperian has abused this system, and his actions border on vandalism. You should look closely at the article's contents the day Hesperian stubbed it. The inappropriate comments about Hart that he cites had been deleted long, long ago.    Hesperian's guesses about an editor's motives are irrelevant.

You just do not like the source, which is funny because over half of America distrusts the Ny Times and Washington Post (PEW Research poll, November 08, 2012)- which you allow.      As for the rest of your rambling diatribe: keep telling yourself that Wiki is a respected source and that no university allows encyclopedia references...  That is a complete absurdity and we both know it.  I am a university professor, and you couldn't be further from the truth.  Encyclopedic references are specifically allowed within the context of general information.  But it matters not as my exercise was mere fabrication.      This whole episode was a performance, in public, to explain to 3 of my students why they received failing grades on a project where they used the Wiki as a source.  I couldn't care any less about Martin Bashir; he's just another extremist talking head, no different than Glen Beck, Rush Limbaugh or Rachel Maddow.  He was selected for the example because he was the guy on the TV when the students came in my office to make their case.  Our University excludes Wikipedia exclusively due to it's abject inaccuracy on practically every subject where """"general consensus"""" holds a particular bias.  My initial examples were the subjects of: race, religion, political affiliation, perceived bias, climate change and economic recovery.  We randomly selected four of the categories and designed the experiment to provide an accurate result.  In every category, each of us attempted to insert ACTION (defined as the actual events) into the wiki page corresponding to the category, from a referenced source, but from a source with perceived bias against the general consensus bias.  All of the links and verbiage were approved by the dept. and student advisory board, and, determined to be entirely accurate.  Those were the rules...  Had any two been successful, they would have gotten a """"B"""" on their project.  All four failed.  Luckily for them, I am kind and gave them 25 extra credit points for this """"test"""" so their project grades didn't kill them (academically).    Our standards and practices board ruled, """"Wikipedia is entirely for entertainment purposes and serves only to reinforce the views of the general consensus.""""  Due to that ruling, Our University physics dept. has renewed it's exclusion of Wikipedia as a source to be cited on anything- graded or not.

We can learn so much more, go so much farther, more reliably, for far less without astronauts imo. Things aren't going to change overnight. And despite future 'plans', I think this will (or at least 'should') be the beginning of the end. And it's long due.  00:33",0,0,0,0,0,0

428c1013fa73de41,"== MSU Interview ==    Dear Cobi,    My name is Jonathan Obar , I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the communityHERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.       So a few things about the interviews:   * Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.   * Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)   * All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.   * All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.   * The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.       Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name instead.    If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.    Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.    Sincerely,    Jonathan Obar",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Also, I've said that I've given reasons for my support votes when asked; there's no difference between that and giving reasons for an oppose vote when asked.

You should be able to find these numbers on the internets if you use the google. Assuming the hydride is sodium hydride (NaH), the product would be sodium hydroxide, and the energy released by the reaction NaH + ½O2 → NaOH would be approximately equal to [ΔHf(NaOH) - ΔHf(NaH)]. That number, which should be negative, represents the amount energy released by the reaction (under standard conditions), and its absolute value is the maximum amount of energy that would be possible to extract from the system. Of course, the whole hydride to wheels spinning energy transfer is not 100% efficient, so there would actually be somewhat less energy available to run the car.

6b00b1c64dd74168,"""    ==Suggested way forward==   After my recent XF-104 tribulations I just had a good read through this article again. It looks like it needs a good clean up before anything else is added, some of it is very good (operators) and some of it is quite bad (pilot impressions).    With the XF-104 article apparently staying I would propose to shorten the development part as the text is duplicated to some extent (I did say I had copied it over) and add a sub heading for YF-104A development programme which was the real start of the F-104 in service to replace the missing development text(to be expanded in good time). Instead of 'design' perhaps 'technical description' of the typical F-104G would be better.   A new section on 'safety record' to merge the existing comments and work on it to put the figures in to context. From my research the majority of Luftwaffe accidents were CFIT (controlled flight into terrain) or engine exhaust nozzle failures followed by the usual bird strikes, spatial disorientation etc. Can we put a 'pie chart' in to illustrate this? I have a list of every German accident and its cause for instance which might open some eyes. Have to say thanks to all the contributors along the way but the article has become fairly messy.

The worse bit is the Pilot impressions section, I have several accounts of the actual handling qualities (one from Roland Beamont who didn't like it), once it's tidied a bit there needs to be a new section on 'Safety record' or something similar where the facts can be shown. I really don't like the nicknames section either although many of those names are accepted, perhaps it needs better referencing (I have no reference to the Italian names apart from 'Spillone' which I believe is 'hatpin' for instance). There is no mention of the ZELL (Zero Length Launch) programme which is fascinating. I think this article could be a GA with some work. Cheers        ::::Good progress I think, we really need an article created for the MAP, Military Assistance Program or Military Aid Program whatever it was called as it is mentioned many times in this article. I can't find anything on it in WP unless I am looking in the wrong place. Was quite a significant program I would guess. I am toying with the idea of changing the operator air force names to their own language equivalents (Koninklijke Luchtmacht for the Netherlands for instance). It won't work for all of them, is there a convention?       :::::Good work so far, Nimbus. It's amazing what can happen when disruptive influences are finally removed. As to operator name language, the usual convention has been to use English equivelants, as in most cases that is also the name of the article on said operator. The notable execption is Luftwaffe. I see no problem, however, listing the native language equivelant at first mention in the text, after the English name. For example: The F-104 was used by the Royal  Netherlands AIr Force (Koninklijke Luchtmacht) from 1234-5678.    :::::Yea, looking much better.

b49d0608108c84de,"""    === Remarks on """"Some remarks"""" ===    I read the technical stuff you wrote just now- some of it is not right. You do NOT get that everything is bosonic by rotating the correlation function- you get exactly spin/statistics independent of whether you use """"P1"""" or """"P2"""". The operator """"R"""" is not what you think it is. It's just a polarization rotation matrix. It could be neither unitary nor antiunitary, because it acts on fields, not on states. It is a very simple polarization rotation matrix, not an operator acting on the Hilbert space of field states.    This is why I don't talk about the Minksowski stuff at all. I don't want to talk about anti-unitary or unitary business, which is completely avoidable if you stay in Euclidean space. It becomes all that in Minkowski space, but that is not necessary for understanding spin/statistics. The argument is simple: if you have the correlation function """"Rphi phi"""", then just by rotation it equals -"""" phi R phi"""" for half integer spin.    I am well aware that Streater and Whitman use the operator """"lambda"""" which does a full parity reversal on all spatial dimensions, but I don't like it. It doesn't generalize to even number of space dimensions, and secondly it does a second rotation in the y-z plane which is completely irrelevant for the argument. The only possible relevance is to ensure that the proper polarization operator is positive definite, but they don't discuss this point in there, as far as I remember.  """,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Shortly before archiving, various sections mentioning an author involved in a conflict of interest were removed by the wikipedia general councel on request of that author, leaving some of the talk sections uninterpretable; see the original talk page history if you need to know more.         ==Move proposal==    I propose that Vaníček analysis be moved to Least-squares spectral analysis, a more descriptive, neutral, and widely used and known term for the topic.  The article has a lot of good well-sourced information on a notable topic, but is written in a biased way aimed apparently at making sure that Vaníček is the main name associated with the method, and that the contributions of others are denied or minimized.  It written by a WP:SPA who has not denied that he is Vaníček's ex-student who wrote the thesis that's used as a source to verify such POV statements as that the """"method has been mistakenly called by some the Lomb-Scargle or simply the Lomb method.""""      :I am rather surprised by these allegations. First of, you first call me an expert and then YOU arbitrarily pick (out of at least five names for the same method) the one that YOU deem to be """"a more descriptive, neutral, and widely used and known term"""". Here is a perfectly logical explanation for my way of presenting the method's name by using just two references (while stating that the name you selected has many references but without stating those specifically  this doens't mean that the name you picked has more references than the name as I stated it  don't mix apples and oranges!): the reason why I included only the first known (from 1970-ies) and the last known (from 2006) reference that cited the method as Vanicek's, was that I hoped this would have been sufficient for an encyclopedia type of article. If you insist, and if you are some kind of authority as you seem to be, I can provide a reference that calls the method """"Vanicek's"""" for every single year between 1970 and 2007! But why flood the article like that?  Second, why are you assuming that not admitting to be some person means you are actually that person? This makes no sense to me.  Last  before accusing me of making up the word """"mistakenly"""", please do read the reference first, before passing accusations like these. I am not here to be insulted like that.   :I appreciate the comment you made on the method authors' biography (I just included the biography source in there, so you should check it). But it seems to me like your contributions to the method article are made not in good faith (not to mention you are not an expert, as you indicated yourself), but in order to say just about anything that comes across your mind. It doesn't seem to me like improvements can be made like that. Please use your powers sparingly. I am here to improve the Wikipedia in the aspect of geodesy, not to waste time and energy fighting you. You should also read the link on biographies that you stated to me: see in there what the Wikipedia inventor says about the Wikipedia rules that obstruct improvements to Wikipedia: he says  IGNORE THEM.      ::I have no power, just trying to help wikipedia be the best it can be, and to learn new stuff along the way; I assume that you would want the attention to your article that you brought by linking it from a whole bunch of signal processing articles.  You, on the other hand, seem to be a WP:SPA, and you'll written an article that's very slanted.  I'm proposing we fix that; I don't see why you would question my good faith here; check my contribs history.       ::But let's talk about the article, instead of making it personal.

195b068e211c115b,"""    == torture of imprisonment victims ==    This article needs some mention of sleep deprivation used to torture victims of imprisonment. I believe that is the most widely used intentional application of sleep deprivation. I don't know where to find documentation of this suitable for publication here, but I have some clues:     * I saw a documentary that mentioned a 1600's swedish prison schedule that had the prisoners being awakened at 4 AM for breakfast and then being allowed to sleep at about 11 or 12 PM, leaving only a few hours of sleep on a prolonged basis. That's the oldest mention I know of off the top of my head of institutionalized torture using sleep deprivation.     * In modern imprisonment facilities, the same thing occurs as in the ancient swedish prison schedule: only a few hours each day are scheduled for prisoner sleep. In addition to the ancient methods, modern prisons also institute regular """"head counts"""" where a prisoner is required to rise from bed and state his name to passing guards.    * Bed checks, cell checks, or just """"the rounds"""" are where a guard is sent to personally look into prisoner cells every 5 to 20 minutes. This is done 24 hours a day, and guards frequently kick and rattle or slam the doors, yell at prisoners, yell to each other, sing songs, or otherwise interrupt a prisoner's already short sleep period.    * Unnaturally hard beds, harder than even earth or wild grasses, keeps prisoners from sleeping due to discomfort.    * Keeping prisoners irritable enlivens boring prison jobs and gives riot suppression teams something to do when prisoners lose the ability to think clearly and make good judgements, which often turns ordinary people into potentially violent ones.     * Prisoners who are already mentally ill go from being public nuisances to being raving loonies while deprived of sleep in the prisons. Even ordinary people will begin to hallucinate, leading to charges of insubordination or other misbehavior that the victim would not do without being sleep deprived.    * Permanent brain damage causes personality changes universally perceived as negative by those close to imprisonment survivors. Subsequent health problems, including psychological issues like PTSD and depression, are considered contributing factors of recidivism.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Having invited you to mediate, I don't want to be tendentious, but I will attempt a single cycle of checking to make sure you understood my concerns.  The conclusion that """"Only 31% of men prescribed finasteride met the eligiblity criteria for the pivotal trials"""" required two logical steps.    :::::1) The authors reviewed the eligibility criteria for the pivotal (pre-approval) clinical trials, and   :::::2) They aggregated and interpreted previously unpublished data about men prescribed the drug from the Northwestern University Enterprise Data Warehouse. Specifically, they set criteria for choosing a comparison population (those administered 1.25 mg or less per day) and analyzed the characteristics of this population to determine the frequency of men having conditions that they believed would have excluded them from the aforementioned trials. This gathering and interpreting of unpublished data to my mind represents pretty much the definition of primary research.     The latter step involved a number of judgement calls that require review by a secondary source.     :::::1) The authors determined """"eligibility"""" by matching the ICD-9 codes of patients from the Northwestern database to relatively vague statements of exclusionary criteria such as """"A history of any illness or condition that might confer additional risk or confound the results"""".  For example, the authors stated that 4.5% of their patients would be ineligible due to obesity, but obesity is not explicitly stated to be an exclusionary criteria for any pre-approval trial.  They presumably decided on their own that obesity """"might confer additional risk"""".      :::::2) A secondary source is needed to assess whether the population that these authors analyzed is representative enough to make the study itself significant.  According to Table 2 of the source document, 8.5% of the patients prescribed propecia at Northwestern would have been ineligible for the pivotal trials because they had cancer.  7.1% were ineligible because of substance abuse issues, 27% were ineligible due to heart disease or hypertension, and nearly 17% had """"disorders of the male genital organs"""".  I personally find it it difficult to believe that nearly 10% of those prescribed propecia nationally have cancer.  This seems to me to be primary research in every sense of the word, and in need of a secondary source for interpretation.     ::::All these things being said, I invited you to mediate, and will not pursue this issue further should you still disagree with me after reviewing these comments.  ||             """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Similar to the Australian Senate, each state has the same number of Senators so that the Eastern states to not control the decision making.  In such as centralised political environment, maybe a similar imbalance is required.  The problem is historically this was done extremely poorly, with the balance way too far towards the regions making the metro areas almost irrelevant, which seems to cloud debate into this concept that 1 vote-1 value is somehow the ultimate democracy.  The issue is that if politicians govern only for the majority, then the disadvantaged/minorities get left behind.  Why build access ramps, provide translation services etc?

If so, your """"over 15,000 reports"""" was actually 14,459 """"computer files"""" - scanned fax pages, probably - which translated into a smaller number of """"reports"""" and an even smaller number of """"significant adverse effect"""" reports, covering a roughly 5-year period (1997-2002). According to the House report linked above, when they finished filing and categorizing everything it amounted to 1,985 reports of significant adverse effects, including 3 (yes, 3!) deaths. My calculation above suggests we should expect ~10 deaths per year (or 50 in 5), so these 3 are probably already accounted for in the existing odds.

ab6f39698ff8e548,"""    == Radcliffe wikify ==    Hi Doops,     My name is . I'm currently on a editing spree of college-related articles. The reason I added a wikify tag to Radcliffe article was because it does not have the same quality as other college articles. I saw on your user page that you are an alum of Harvard. If you would like to help wikify the Radcliffe article, please see my edits of UMass Amherst. As for your comment as to why I didn't do the editing myself, an article doesn't just become wikified by the insertion of link tags. Even your own Harvard College is far more wikified than the Radcliffe page.    In the future, please pose questions as to tags in the Discussion page of the article in question, thanks!      (copied from     :Hi, Varun. I think you may be misunderstanding the word """"wikify"""". Wikification isn't so much a question of content as of how that content is formatted — in particular, is there a healthy dose of internal wikipedia links? Typically, the """"wikify"""" tag is used for articles with large chunks of undigested text, often cut-and-pasted from the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica or other public domain source. They need formatting, links, and often lots of rewriting to make them encyclopedic in tone. Adding the tag to an article automatically adds it to the huge (currently ca. 2000 articles) Category:Articles that need to be wikified; for the sake of the sanity of the brave souls who try, largely in vain, to rescue articles like this from this category, we should only send articles there which really need it.    :As far as article quality is concerned, I would argue that Radcliffe College is actually a much better article than Harvard College right now. The latter is rambling, poorly-organized, and gives too much attention to some things and not enough attention to others; since I know something about the college I feel I really ought to make it a better article — but it's a daunting task. The Radcliffe College article, on the other hand, is direct and to-the-point; it makes the most important points about that college clearly. It is shorter, of course; but that's a separate issue from quality, I would argue. Harvard College has lots of info but is a crummy article; Radcliffe College is brief but well-written and -organized.    :Should Radcliffe College be longer? Maybe. But let me point out that Radcliffe College no longer exists; it has been defunct in law since 1999 and in practice since the mid 1970s. It's only natural that living colleges will have more active articles. And, even aside from that, I believe that article quality is as least as important as quantity of information, as long as all the important bases are covered. Don't get me wrong  it's always possible to add interesting new info to articles; and I'm not opposed to the possibility of growth for the Radcliffe College article. I just don't think it's a priority, when so many Wikipedia articles are crummy.    :By the way, I presume you know this already; but in case you don't — if you come across a really short article (just a paragraph or two) which isn't already marked as a stub, you can use the {{stub}} tag to do so. But again, like the {{wikify}} tag, we should only use it where truly appropriate.    :Cheers,  |  """,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

f8dcf4643a1e028b,"""    Deer Island.    Private getaway to the Skull & Bones Society.    What do they do there?    They raise children for sex and sex alone.    When members of Yale's most secret of secret societies go there as a """"getaway,"""" they do not bring their girlfriends. They instead bring small keys [with skull-and-crossbone designs on them, how original] made of various metals [typically gold, sometimes platinum; mixed with stronger substances for strength, of course] taken from the teeth of dead enemies. Mostly fillings, though.    What do these keys unlock?    Locks to the various underground chambers scattered about the island. There are fifteen tombs of this type [one for each member of this year's chosen bonesmen].    The girls are allowed to grow no older than fourteen years old.    They are abused, raped, and taught to like it from birth. They have no nationality, no recognizable country of origin. Typically they're the offspring of gullible [but clean] whores that are brought to Deer Island by clever bonesmen. The whores are killed after the childbirth [and detained on the island during the nine months leading up to it].    At thirteen, the girls are allowed to bear children. Before this age, abortions are routine, one of the island's few year-round residents is an abortionist. He is well paid, and is one of the only non-bonesmen ever allowed to take place in the childsex.    Once the thirteen/fourteen year old girls have given birth, they are taken into what are near-exact replicas of the gas chambers at Auschwitz camp I [only crafted from ornate stonework; there are etchings on the walls of various Skull-and-Bones images, the number 322, etc.]. They're told that this will be the site of a celebration of their new child's birth. A futon in the middle of the room is where the child is fucked for the final time, before being choked until unconscious, and gassed [once the bonesman has left the chamber safely, of course].    For having made mention of ANY of this, I could be killed.    The girls are given trust tests at age eight, before fellatio can become part of their sexual repertoire.    The bonesman will lay his potential cocksucker down on a cold concrete floor in the middle of a well-lit auditorium underground, and force her to lay spread-eagle. He then inserts a straight razor into her VAGINA, vertically, slowly, being careful so as to minimize any potential damage. One flinch from the girl, and the blade is pulled up through the uterus, and the girl is then disposed of [the bonesmen often HOPE for a twitch from the girl, so they can mutilate her with the razor just for fun]. If the child remains calm, the razor is removed, and she is """"rewarded"""" with the privelege of getting to suck the cock of one of the most powerful men in the world.    Semen must be swallowed, if fellatio is performed. If the child can't get the bonesman off, he will grab her head, and give a warning thrust, jamming his PENIS into the back of her throat. She is given a couples seconds to recover, and the quality of her blowjob must either improve, or she will get another thrust, harder this time. If a third thrust is necessary, the bonesman does not let go of her head at all, but rams it into his pelvis, until he ejaculates. The girl is often unable to breathe by the end of this, and so, the razor comes out, and the girl is finished off. This very rarely happens though, the girls are taught the proper respect by the time they reach the age of eight.    That's all I can share safely tonight; I'll try to post more soon. I need to make it look like I'm here doing research.    -""""322 minus one""""   http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/Skull-And-Bones1833-1985.htm""",0,0,0,0,0,0
