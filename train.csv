681bceb39ce09938,"""  I think we need to ask who is likely to be visiting this disambiguation page. For some, it will be a matter of a typographical similarity and for some it will be seeking a different topic. But I believe for most it will be because, having encountered OpenOffice.org historically, they are researching the topic of either the word processors they used to know as OpenOffice.org or possibly the file formats they pioneered. Those people need to have a clear navigation path to the full family of articles which someone seeking """"OpenOffice.org"""" would now seek. For me, that means clear and co-located pointers to Apache OpenOffice and to LibreOffice (I'm not of the opinion NeoOffice matters much but I'm sure others will differ).

c23791a01041e053,"""  THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:  Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,  You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.  May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.  There is a constant undermining of the cityÂ´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.  The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.  It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.  This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.  In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self.

521bf184f57368bd,""", 11 August 2006 (UTC)  I certainly do not have a problem with this user CORRECTING birth date years to reflect the truth, provided some kind of proof is given in the form of a link to an authoritative web site or other source.

It may be that the user inadvertently hit on a """"correct"""" year purely by accidental coincidence, particularly if there are """"source information"""" sites that have alternate years of birth posted as well.

It is believed that these children experience a rise in dopamine levels as a result of a of cross-reactive anti-neuronal antibodies triggered by streptococcal or mycoplasma infection.  The cross-reaction is believed to cause such side effects as tics.     No.  1.  You are misreading the source.  Tics are hypothetically a feature of PANS, but you've extended that to TS, which misses the whole point of the PANS hypothesis.  PANS is hypothetically posed as a condition in which symptoms are not better explained by another condition such as Tourette's, so your text is wrong.  Second, there is exactly one paper written about PANS, it is a proposal, see WP:RECENTISM, and there is no reason to include speculative text in a Featured article.  If more papers are published, and if PANS gains some widespread medical consensus, and if secondary reviews discuss it, then you might propose accurate text here discussing the situation. I'm a bit concerned that you are editing both PANDAS and PANS, and yet your definition of the hypothetical PANS above does not seem to match the cited source, which discusses abrupt onset of OCD.  Furthermore, PANS is proposed for research purposes until there is more coverage, it doesn't belong in this (an unrelated) article.   (Talk)   See above. SHOOS  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

c1868fc497612fd9,"Hello Hi Hertz.... I want to introduce myself. My name is Nate. I noticed that you are an active editor and participant to the article on Radio. Let me say congrats on the great work that you do. The reason why I am writing to you is to give a fair warning. A few days ago I made an edit or two to the article on the Marconi vs. U.S. case that essentially gave the radio patent to Tesla in 1943. The references I gave as you probably saw, were reliable and verifiable.  however as you also probably saw, I think I may have stirred the pot. Anything pinning Tesla to the underlying principles of radio is never acceptable to another editor on that article, Magnagr. So I wanted to warn you. I have fought him tooth and nail for over a year over this agonizing subject. I've reverted several of his unsourced edits, but he will not rest until he fulfills his agenda. His current user name is not even his first as he has several registered accounts on Wikipedia. I have a feeling that nationaliatic pride is also playing at hand here with him as I think he told me once that he was Italian. Hence, that is why he would want to only accredit Marconi as the sole contributor to radio. So it is just a warning. You and the others should be prepared to fight this with him as he will never stop. I gave up a long time ago. I have radio on my watch list so I will be following along and keeping my eyes open to the edits he makes. But you should as well pay very very  close attention what he does.

No control for mass was done in either experiment, and evaporation of order of less than microgram per second could easily explain the effect (especially in the NASA case); even more so, if there is some moisture. What you are essentially doing, is microwaving the interior of a cone, and - surprise surprise - there is a small force in the opposite direction. Then you turn off the heating, but your interior is still at higher temperature, measure it again, and there is still a force - yet smaller. Nothing to do with exotic physics, everything to do with experimental error due to unforeseen effect of evaporation, i.e. ablation (though some moisture might play an effect, especially if there are parts other than metal; this is, in my opinion, the most likely explanation - EM radiation cannot cause such effect at these power/force ratios (that part was also removed from the article, though all was sourced). So, if there is no some weird effect (and QED effects, virtual plasma included, boil down to EM radiation reaction, there is no violation of impulse conservation there, so that is excluded too), it should be reaction from some loss of mass - and evaporation is an obvious source. However, they did not check for that. Also, some of experiments were done in atmosphere (at atmospheric pressure, even in chamber?! according to brief paper), so other possibility is interaction with heated air. However, in vacuum, ablation seems to be most likely explanation. Why all this sourced material and all criticism was removed, beats me. 213.198.221.171",0,0,0,0,0,0

When I wrote """"75(note 15)"""" above, I should have written """"75([superscript:]??"""" looks like """"25"""" or """"2.5"""" in GBooks' representation. When I looked at this entry on p. 3-366 before, it looked like """"15"""". Also, on """"Explanation of Table"""" p. 3-2, I read """"The data in the table have many sources, including both the primary literature and evaluated compilations.  The Handbook of Data on Organic Compounds, Third edition (Ref. 7) and the Combined Chemical Dictionary (Ref. 8) were important sources. Other useful sources of physical property data on organic compounds are listed in Refs. 9-19.  The values in the table for the normal boiling point and the melting point that are accompanied with uncertainties (in parenthesis) have been critically evaluated using the NIST ThermoData Engine (TDE, Ref. 20), designed to implement the dynamic data evaluation concept (Refs. 21-24).  This concept requires large electronic databases capable of storing essentially all relevant data known to date with detailed descriptions of metadata and uncertainties.  The combination of these electronic databases with expert-system software, designed to automatically generate recommended property values based on available experimental and predicted data, leads to the ability to produce critically evaluated data dynamically, 'to order.' The uncertainties listed are combined expanded uncertainties (level of confidence, approximately 95 %) representing the most comprehensive measure of the overall data reliability (Refs, 25-28)."""" So this suggests that some temperature values in the table are automatically derived but as I say, the """"25"""" or """"2.5"""" is a raised, reduced-sized font, not parenthesized. So the superscript may well refer to alternate sample pressure - I can't find whatever it references. I apologize if this dwells on this source too much; I think the consensus here that the bp is significantly higher than 75'C is dispositive.      """,0,0,0,0,0,0

f04947d0e606e6fe,"""== Removing Dyer references ==  I propose removing from the references section the books written by Dyer. I have not read Dyer's books, but from what Node_ue says, it seems to me that he's just a crank. He appears to have no clue in linguistics.  I don't think a sane linguist would take two random people, put them to translate a text from Yiddish, compare the resulting texts and get to the conclusion: """"yep, we have two different languages"""".  Also, he uses made-up expressions such as """"sovetul (sic!) de deputaÅ£i"""" or """"cuvinte slujitoare"""" to prove his points, which is akin to data fabrication in regular science.   Bogdan, Dyer did not come to the conclusion that Moldovan and Romanian are truly separate languages. With regards to the parallel translation, he says """"the greatest difference between these two texts are in the vocabularies and in the styles they employ. There is a more 'flowering' prose in the Moldovan text... to reiterate, the difference here is one of style, not one of substance"""".   Actually, """"le style est l'homme mÃªme"""", as Buffon once said. Dyer starts from the premise that the style in each country is homogenous: it is not, there are much more differences between different individuals in the same country. His ways of studying language is just as useless as the way the Nazis studied genetics by assuming the homogenity of the Aryan race.     Yes, that's his point. That nearly all of the differences between the two passages are not differences between two languages, but just because two different translators.  Earlier, you said """"...a sane linguist would take two random people, put them to translate a text from Yiddish..."""". Actually, he got these comparisons from published translations in """"Romanian"""" and """"Moldovan"""". He didn't just walk up to random people on the street.    The only actual possible grammatical difference he finds in the texts is Moldovan """"pe tot ce vretsi"""", and Romanian """"pe cÃ®t vretsi"""". There were very few web results for """"pe tot ce vreti"""" (about 5), and one of them was from the Zdob shi Zdub website (a Moldovan band). There were no results in Moldova for """"pe cit vreti""""/""""pe cat vreti"""". So that may or may not be valid. I personally would say """"pe tot ce vretsi"""". But I don't know if it's real.   I suppose this is part of an expression, such as """"jur pe tot ce vrei"""" or """"pun pariu pe tot ce vrei"""". Anyway, both sound common enough in Romanian and sounds pretty subjective choosing one for Romanian and one for Moldovan.    Now, neither of those expressions is """"made up"""". He takes both from M. Bruchis' work, """"one step back, two steps forward"""" which is also quite critical of the notion of an independent Moldovan language.   But can this author prove they exist? Probably not, since no google hits are found.     Michael Bruchis, you mean? I'm sure he can. He's an expert, too. He wrote an entire book on the subject. Just because no Google hits exist doesn't mean an expression isn't real  do you find any Google results for cit vreti%22+site%3A.md or cat vreti%22+site%3A.md? Or even tot ce vreti%22+site%3A.md? No, you don't. But that doesn't mean that nobody says those things in Moldova. How many results do you find for """"instrumente gramaticale""""? 37, and none of them are at .md websites. You can find the word """"cuvintelnic"""" on Google, but does that mean it's really the Moldovan word for """"dictionar""""? No, Moldovan ppl only use that word when we're joking. (dexonline.ro finds 0 results too). Just because a term occurs or doesn't occur on Google, doesn't mean it is or isn't real.    """"sovetul"""" is not a misspelling. Rather, it's a Soviet-era spelling  """"soviet"""" was spelt as """"sovet"""". Some Moldovans still spell it that way although it's usually considered incorrect; however he is quoting the phrase from Bruchis, who published his work a bit earlier when the spelling was still accepted.

They debate whether he preached the imminent end of the world, his connection to religious groups (such as the Essenes), and which sayings attributed to him are actually his. The so-called quest for the historical Jesus began with Hermann Samuel Reimarus and continues today with scholars such as the fellows of the Jesus Seminar.""""

T   Re  I tagged Byron Long for speedy deletion since it appeared to be entirely unreferenced, which, given the controversial nature of the subject matter, would constitute a serious WP:BLP violation.  WP:BLP states that Administrators encountering biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone, where there is no NPOV version to revert to, should delete the article without discussion (see Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion criterion G10 for more details).  Looking through the page history, however, it appears that there actually was a reference for the article, which I have restored.   CSD G10 does use the term """"negative in tone"""", which is a somewhat unfortunate choice of words.  The more fundamental policy here appears to be Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons, which states that """"biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone"""" should be speedily deleted.  The underlying issue is not whether we believe that a description of a living person as a """"porn actor"""" is actually negative.  Rather, for WP:BLP purposes, the issue is whether, if an article incorrectly described someone as a """"porn actor"""", such a description would be regarded as defamatory for the purpose of Wikipedia:Libel  that is, whether such an incorrect description, if widely believed, might be likely to have a significantly adverse effect on the employment prospects or general reputation of the subject of the article.  I would contend that describing someone as a """"porn actor"""" is sufficiently """"controversial in tone"""" to invoke WP:BLP concerns for the speedy removal and/or deletion of any unreferenced claims of this nature.

Serbs were a docile folk who, essentially, didn't fight """"their place under the sun"""". Their very name signified servitude of a sort, as evidenced by the DAI's etymology. They lost every battle  with foreigners they ever fought, placed themselves under Byzantine suzerainty amd were saved from extinction by Croats who crushed Bulgarian aggression  3. there are historical documents galore, which testify about Croatian legal, parliamentary and cultural continuity: from the times of Trpimir and KreÅ¡imir to the later corpora.  4. Croatian language heritage in the vernacular is well attested in from the 13th century on (at least). They Croatian name is explicitly mentioned in various sources, both Äakavian and Å tokavian, particularly in Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Bosnia. Moreover, linguistic characteristics are the same as with contemporary (mid-19th century) Croatian language. On the other hand, Serbian written works, up until Dositej and Vuk (1780-1820), were written exclusively in Church Slavic language. Serbian literature until Vuk is, essentially, a variant of Church Slavic literature flourishing in Byzantium influenced area. Hence-Vuk's linguistic pan-Serbism, which tried to appropriate all Å¡tokavian vernacular literature is, evidently, a falsity and concoction.  5. early Slavic studies (Å araÅik et al.) were deluded in ascribing parts of the Croatian literature to the Serbian heritage.  6. Serbian ethnic affiliation, in modern terms, is a relatively new phenomenon in Croatia. The major part of Eastern Orthodox inhabitants of Croatia, who actively participated in the Croatian cultural life (Illyrian movemont) have begun to show Serbian national allegiance only in recent (1850s) years.   Virtually all StarÄeviÄ's claims are corroborated by historical sources available at his times. Whether the veracity of historical sources like the DAI can withstand the test of time-this is another question. But, from the vantage point of mid-19th century clash of Serbian and Croatian ideologies, StarÄeviÄ polemic stands as an example of skilled, sometimes sardonic and always truthful debate-without distortions, lies or misappropriations. Sarcasm hurts-but, this is what the polemic is all about.          """,0,0,0,0,0,0

b9022813bdf238d5,"""== Discussing recombination ==  Recently I noticed that this article uses 'genetic recombination' to refer to recombination that occurs during in meiosis and brings about genetic diversity among organisms.  This isn't necessarily correct: genetic recombination can also refer to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or V(D)J recombination, neither of which, to my knowledge, occur during meiosis or produce heritable genetic diversity among organisms.  To account for that, I think it would be helpful to replace instances of 'genetic recombination' with 'homologous recombination', the type of genetic recombination to which this article refers.  What are others' thoughts on this?  The only drawback I could see would be the slightly less reader-friendly word 'homologous'. This, however, seems clarified by the first sentence in the 'Sex and recombination' section to invoke the phrase: """"In the related process of genetic recombination, sexual organisms can also exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes.""""  If the inaccessibility of the word 'homologous' were in fact a drawback, I think it would be more than compensated for by the greater accuracy of the information being presented to the reader.  Yesterday I tried introducing this change, but was reverted.  In the summary of that reversion, the editor noted: """"why be less general? homologous excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc.""""  I've offered my rationale for being specific just above, but was curious about the second sentence.  If homologous recombination excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc., then is that somehow accounted for by other types of genetic recombination, like NHEJ or V(D)J recombanation?  To my understanding, it is a failure of homologous recombination in meiosis that produces heritable chromosome translocations, fusions, and gene duplications.      I think you are correct, being more accurate is better since the sentence does refer specifically to matching chromosomes. I've reworded this to state In a related process called homologous recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. I've added the idea of general recombination to the previous section, adding Mutations can involve large sections of DNA becoming duplicated, usually through genetic recombination.      Charles Darwin film 'too controversial for religious America'   """"A British film about Charles Darwin has failed to find a US distributor because his theory of evolution is too controversial for American audiences, according to its producer.""""      That's a laugh. Please don't try to make evolution look like it's a helpless victim being attacked by a bunch of religious nuts. The theory of evolution does have many loopholes, but America is not religious by any means; I'm shocked that an American producer turned down the film. âPreceding unsigned comment added by  (talk â¢ contribs)   Sorry, I just don't see how evolution can be a controversial topic - evolution is all around us, simple as that. People who tend to object to such basic fundamental facts of life tends not to understand the depth of the topic to the point of understanding it, but rather the shallow aspect to justify their lack of understanding. Not everyone is good at science so some people would tend to take the shallow route of critizing something if they don't understand. Example; I'm terrible at pre-calculus so I critize the aspect of pre-calculus to justify my understanding - see where I'm getting at?  Not relevant here. The Evolution article is not about Charles Darwin, the film is not about evolution, and there is an entirely separate page for the creationâevolution controversy.

These would seem to support an assertion that she dismissed critics as bitchy. How many times in one piece must we read such dismissals before we conclude that she dismisses critics as bitchy? And how, however you view my sentence construction, does it amount to bias? You have made the assertion. It is now down to you to explain yourself.  (talk)   This isn't going away, Surtsicna. You no more get to walk away from this than you would if you'd accused a banker of fraud or a teacher of child abuse. Either explain how any of my actions amount to bias, withdraw the accusation, or accept that you are a deeply flawed individual lacking in the basic common courtesies. And - again as common courtesy - start using edit summaries. There really is no excuse for your behaviour.  (talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

09a18078f340ff62,"""  UFC AFDs  Those were never transcluded to the AfD page so there's probably not a lot of point them existing.  I'm a bit pushed for time today, so if you want to remove the AfD banners from the articles, I'll delete the AfD pages when I get the chance.    I haven't been able to spend much time on Wikipedia lately.  Looks like they've been """"officially"""" listed as AfDs.  I'll leave them alone for now.       Jake Bostwick  I've only nominated a few, very obvious MMA people before.  Bostwick was deleted via AfD discussion.  A speedy delete on grounds of it being deleted before was denied.  To me, he still fails WP:MMANOT, but I'm in no way a MMA expert.  What do you think?    At first glance it appears that Bostwick hasn't fought at the """"highest level"""" of MMA as required by WP:ATHLETE (or whatever the guideline is these days) and WP:MMANOT.  If I had an interest in having the article removed, I would AfD it again.      Hello, It has been brought to my attention from an outside source about this discussion. Can I first point out that Jake Bostwick is a former UCMMA middleweight champion and currently the UCMMA welterweight champion? UCMMA is, along with BAMMA and Cage Warriors, the biggest MMA promotion in the United Kingdom.   Secondly, after glancing over WP:MMANOT and WP:ATHLETE, I see that they are indeed guidelines. Now I may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me, a guideline is optional when it comes to following it, meaning that they cannot be used in AfDs as the sole reason why to delete any article.   Thirdly, I have spent much time working on the page (as well as being the creator of the page), I have found very strong sources from websites such as The Sun, The Mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a 'typical' mixed martial artist's Wikipedia page, as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called Party Wars, and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a Wheel Clamper only strengthens his notability. The very sources on him alone helps him pass WP:GNG, which is all you need to pass a page on Wikipedia in my opinion.  I would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more, but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion I find is a bit disrespectful towards me, however I fairness to you we haven't exactly known each other for a while, so now I have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the page's position on Wikipedia, now we can talk to help improve the page even more.      User:Pound4Pound   Since you filed the SPI, I wanted to update you that I've reversed the block.  I requested another editor to review the case, and while there are a lot of coincidences, he felt it was borderline enough based on behavior, that the block should be reversed and instead just monitor the situation.  I had some reservations going into the block, but it seemed likely, however, I fully respect the review and would ask we all give the benefit of the doubt in this case.

6b8736d880131dd6,"""  Expanding claims of mistreatment with other witnesses 29-Apr-2010: It is time to greatly expand the section about Claims of Mistreatment, to include numerous other sources. Originally, that section was quickly created to begin the topic. At first, the issue was treated as a """"he said she said"""" dispute (when there are no other witnesses than just the 2 sides making claims). However, now, there are probably 10 or 15 witnesses to add into that section, including:  In June 2009, Knox testified they repeatedly asked, """"Did you hear Meredith scream?"""" and she replied no, no, and no. When they insisted how was that possible, she claims that she said, """"I don't know; perhaps I had my fingers in my ears."""" That became: """"Knox put her fingers in her ears when she heard Kercher screaming"""" (invented false confession).  Knox's father attended those trial hearings and he confirmed her statements as consistent with his conversations with Amanda, for years.  Knox's father stated that a female officer linked to hitting Knox was charged with beating another suspect.  One of the police officers (from that night) testified that Knox was so pressured during the intense interrogation that she starting screaming (not hearsay).  Patrik L. (Knox's boss at the pub Le Chic) stated that he was also pressured and threatened by police officers on the same day.  Author Douglas Preston, in several reports, has stated that he was also pressured and threatened by the same prosecutor, and commented about that in relation to Knox's testimony. All such statements are allowed, per Wikipedia policies, because they are not WP:SYN synthesis, but rather reported in single sources describing the claims of mistreatment. The current text of the section must be expanded per WP:NOTCENSORED and WP:NOTPAPER. Expect the article to exceed 200kb, when similar basic details have been added. -  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

e1e455df19ad4130,"14Feb07  Cristina,  Am I allowed to wish you a Happy Valentine's day, or is that verboten?!  Anyway, how are things? Have you moved into the new apartment yet? If not when? I'm really looking forward to paying you a visit and seeing it for myself - and of course you and Kerim! Don't forget when you are settled to send me some pics of the place.  You asked about Connie and Elvira. They are both well thanks. Tomorrow Connie will visit her parents for a couple of weeks to celebrate the New Year. It must be amazing to be in China for their New Year - it is such a big event. I know travelling and hotels in China at this time is a nightmare, but I still think it would be an unforgettable experience. Maybe next year..  Life in Peru is good; no news though. I'll phone Elvira this afternoon and then see her on messenger this evening after German. Are you and Kerim going to do anything special today? Romantic meal with wine and candles, followed by a quiet walk under a moonlit sky?! Or will he come home late from work, drunk and with lipstick on his collar?  ;-)  Is next Monday a bank holiday for you? It is here but I'm not too sure what to do. Claire has invited me to Lake Constance, something I need to think about. Or I could spend three days studying German -(  BlÃ¶Ã¶dy German. If Europe wants one common currency, then why not also one common language? (Not French - Sorry Kerim!) To be honest I don't like my German lessons. The teaching format is, for me, very unconventional. There is very little reading and writing - almost nothing. Instead we are 'supposed' to learn through talking and repeating. While I know this will be perfect for some, not everyone can learn in this way. I sure you know the three ways people learn: aural, visual and kinestic. Well I know I'm a mixture of visual and kinestic. And when it comes to learning a language I have to see it written on paper, write it several times and actually use the words. Also she, the teacher, is not supposed to talk in English. Which begs the question how can she explain something complex without explaining to us in our own language. OK, enough moaning about German!  Thankfully I am not suffering from spending yesterday evening in the gym. I am hoping that I become addicted to the place and that I *have* to go to get my 'fix'. Tomorrow I have a fitness assessment which will be interesting. Next week will be the induction and I shall be given a program to follow. They also have lots of classes which is one of the reasons I chose to join this gym. Along with the muscle/fitness classes they also have more relaxing classes: yoga, pilates, etc. which I quite like. I find listening/understanding the class instructor hard enough in English, so to do it in German will be amusing! The gym I go to is in the centre but there is one closer to my home; not too sure how to get there though. Elvira wasn't pleased when I told her the showers and saunas are mixed! You know how jealous those latinas are ;-)  OK, time for me to leave you in peace. Please give my greetings to all and you take care. I shall be in touch again soon.  Besitos, Dave",0,0,0,0,0,0

The multi-stage fitness test, also known as the bleep test, beep test, pacer test, Leger-test or 20-m shuttle run test, is used by sports coaches and trainers to estimate an athlete's VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake). The test is especially useful for players of sports like rugby, soccer, Australian rules football, hockey, netball, handball, tennis, squash and fitness testing at schools and colleges plus many other sports; employed by many international sporting teams as an accurate test of Cardiovascular fitness, one of the all-important """"Components of Fitness"""". This test is also part of the FITNESSGRAM - Commercial Link, incorrect and unrelated to the Multi-stage Fitness Test physical fitness test to measure cardiorespiratory - Typo fitness. The test was created by Luc Leger, University of Montreal[1] published in 1983, """"A Maximal Multistage 20m Shuttle Run Test to predict VO2 Max"""", and was re-published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology (vol 49 pp 1â12) in 1988 in its present form with 1 min stages under the name """"Multistage 20-m shuttle run test for aerobic fitness"""".[2] Result equivalences between slightly modified versions are well explained by Tomkinson et al. in 2003.[3] The beep test world record is 19.2, held by HÃ¥kan Mild.[4][unreliable source?] - Embedded Commercial Link LAZYRUNNER added as Reference  2.

This is supposed to be the original source of the genus name, and conceivably gives some insight as to where the name was meant to come from. (Primary sources aren't ideal, but a self-contradictory secondary source isn't better.) Presumably there is some defining and identifying property of the fish's fin, which not only gives it the name but would more broadly also be worth mentioning in the article.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The remainder of the problem is to do with semantic markup (i.e. semantic wiki markup, not particularly semantic HTML). I believe that there are several projects to do with the semantic web that use Wikipedia info boxes to obtain categorised data about the article subjects. Semantically, what we now state is that there are seven entries under past_members, two of whom are 'Principal lineâup' and 'Other members' Messrs line-up and members will appear to semantic data harvesting software to have been past members of The Beatles. There is a world of difference between putting text into bold type and labelling text with a meaningful heading. Therefore the discussion should continue at Template talk:Infobox musical artist until the fields and labels of the info box are altered to be in line with this proposal.

History From alpha to omega, here is an aperÃ§u. My work on Wikipedia commenced rather abruptly when I made my debut using 207.97.213.170. My subsequent edits were along the same line. I was promptly blocked for vandalism. In retrospect, I understand that my edits were definitely not constructive, but I would not construe them as vandalism, as I was just an abecedarian then.   I returned with Hiineedrequestforcomment to """"pursue defense of my actions on my previous account"""". I was quite hostile to Jpgordon and continued to argue my case quite impolitely, insulting other users. After making my only constructive edit, I was blocked for """"trolling and harassment"""". I continued to argue against my block, and my block settings were changed, disabling me from editing at all.  I returned with The Reformed Editor, truly thinking I was reformed. I created my userpage declaring that I was the alternate account of Hiineedrequestforcomment. I made several improvements to Julia Mancuso, Shaun White, Ted Ligety, Purna, Akola city, and 2010 Winter Olympics, but then I started arguing with users about the ranking of the 2010 Winter Olympics medal table. I do admit that my actions were quite inappropriate. AprÃ¨s reading my userpage promulgation, Andrwsc blocked me. I asked him tersely, """"Does [my block] mean that all indefinitely-blocked users cannot ever return to Wikipedia to make changes, even if they are helpful?"""" This prompted him to change the block settings of Hiineedrequestforcomment to allow me to make my offer. Here I am now.  Declarations I pledge allegiance to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. However, that promise has unfortunately been denied to me. I promise to let sleeping dogs lie. It was my obsession with pursuing justice of that petty IP that led to my downfall. I promise to continue making constructive edits. The following are the inexhaustive diffs for all the constructive edits I have made: Bode Miller Julia Mancuso Shaun White Ted Ligety Purna Akola city 2010 Winter Olympics And many more. . . I issue an apology to all those editors who have construed me as a detriment to Wikipedia.  Final Thoughts The year of 2009 was an annus mirabilis, but my only regret was not coming to Wikipedia earlier. To Andrwsc: you didn't think much of my constructive edits. Yes, they may not have promoted articles to Featured Article of Good Article statuses, but nonetheless, they were improvements to the general quality of Wikipedia.Also, I don't understand why you are giving me this chance when you say at the Administrators' noticeboard that you """"would personally !vote oppose to an unblock"""". Does that mean I have no chance of getting unblocked? I will assay to refrain from argufying that may launch into a full-scale argumentum. I hope to participate in the development of an accurate, just, collegial ambiance here on Wikipedia. For me, in the aftertime, I hope to develop mutual understanding with my fellow editors. My amour propre is quite high now, so please don't ruin it.

Using a blood donation organization as a proxy STD test is highly irresponsible; if the testing is not 100% perfect (and in never is), and the person trying this is positive (and presumably anyone who is considering doing this considers this to be entirely possible), they will almost certainly (because of pre-test blood pooling, and the very large blood volumes involved) infect one or more unwitting third parties with a potentially lethal disease.  Instead, they should get tested at their local sexual health clinic.      People just wanting to make sure are no more likely to have an STD than other first-time blood donors.. I don't see your point: If that kind of carelessness goes on things would happen *anyway*  (ÎâÎ© Â¦ ââ)   It's reasonable to assume that people who take part in high-risk activities are at higher risk than other members of the population. In epidemiology terms, it's assortative mixing among people with high risk tolerance; people who take part in one high-risk activity are more likely to take part in others, including taking part in these activities with multiple partners; and no, you can't trust your partner who tells you """"I've never done anything like this before, either"""". Consider the outbreaks of HIV in the regularly-tested adult movie industry; this in a population that take part in high-risk activities, and yet are all tested monthly.     Hmm I guess that makes sense, kinda  I would be interested in reading if you feel like creating articles for """"assortative mixing"""" and """"risk tolerance"""" maybe  or   (ÎâÎ© Â¦ ââ)  I'm not familiar with the article or the subject of its concern, but I fail to see how saying """"X does Y"""" constitutes an actual endorsement of Y.  If such a method is indeed commonplace then, regardless of the advisability of such method for practitioners of said activity, it should be included as part of the article on that activity.     Karada, I think you miss the point here.  Just because certain behavior is inadvisable does not mean Wikipedia should not state that people engage in it (if indeed they do) and describe it.  Certainly, the encyclopedia should not ENDORSE it (but then again, neither should it endorse anything elseNPOV and all that), but simply stating that it happens and describing what it is hardly constitutes an endorsement.

First of all, I don't have a negative attitude towards the Romans, or the Greeks, or the Macedonians or anyone from Western antiquity. I'm really not that interested in Classical history beyond basic knowledge. What I AM interested in is keeping the wiki clean.  As far as having the article locked, it was put into what's called """"semi-protected"""" mode. In semi-protect, anonymous users cannot edit the article, and neither can newly  registered accounts. This is to prevent vandalism from occuring - people putting in nonsense or swearing for no reason, that kind of thing. By the time you read this note you should have had your account long enough that you can now edit the article. I will warn you that trying to put in uncited material or stuff that goes against the manual of style will probably be deleted again, although not by me.  Another suggestion would be to use the Apollo discussion page to air your concerns. Two of the five wikiprojects that have staked a claim on Apollo ( Wikiproject Classical Greece and Rome and  Wikiproject Mythology) are known for their accuracy and attention to detail. They can probably give you reasons for why the content looks like it does.

I feel this demonstrates that """"Ashlee Simpson"""" is still the correct title. Does anyone oppose moving it back?     I was going to say the same thing. Her legal name is irrelevant, this article should be at the most commonly used name that most people know her by, which is obviously Ashlee Simpson. 92.1.2.237   Yes, and even her official website still calls her """"Ashlee Simpson"""".     I will move the page back to """"Ashlee Simpson"""" in 24 hours unless there is an objection, or unless Google News indicates a significant trend toward general adoption of the """"Simpson-Wentz"""" name.     I searched Ashlee Simpson as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz and pages are starting to refer to her as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz. Let's keep the article as-is.  âPreceding unsigned comment added by 24.151.137.19     Yeah, I've searched her as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz in Google News, and they've started referring to her as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz. The article is fine the way that it is.     You can see the numbers I posted a few days ago above. The current numbers are 3,358 for """"Ashlee Simpson"""" and 559 for """"Ashlee Simpson-Wentz"""". I don't see a trend towards the latter. Most of the newest articles refer to her as """"Ashlee Simpson"""".     Considering that she got married a couple weeks ago, I think that 559 results as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz is a good number of articles. It will probably increase as more articles are written.    If that were the case, we'd see a trend, but what I see is that there was a spike in the use of the new name after it was announced, but that subsequently most sources continued to use the old name. The results indicate to me that the new name hasn't caught on.     Read this:  she's taking Pete's surname and is going by Simpson-Wentz professionally. I think this settles this dicussion. 24.151.137.19   The point is that it doesn't matter what she calls herself. Wikipedia articles are titled according to the common name of the subject.     Exactly. Ashlee is changing her common name. 24.151.137.19   She can't change her common name. Her common name is decided according to what people want to call her. If they now start calling her Ashlee Simpson-Wentz, then that's her new common name, but if they keep calling her Ashlee Simpson, then that remains her common name. That's why I've been comparing Google News results, to see whether this new name is really catching on. Also, as I pointed out, her website still uses her old name, but maybe they're just lazy. Since there are two of you in favor of keeping it at this title, I propose that we wait one week, then look at the results again and see if there's more of a shift towards Simpson-Wentz.     I just noticed that Danny has been going around changing the articles on her albums so that they are described as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz albums. Considering we don't even have a consensus on what she should be called now, I don't think it's appropriate to try to extend the Simpson-Wentz name to album articles which were released under the Ashlee Simpson name before she married Pete.     I've searched Google News for Ashlee Simpson, which had 3,162 results, and Ashlee Simpson-Wentz, which had 1,613 results. So clearly, the results for Ashlee Simpson are dropping while results for Ashlee Simpson-Wentz are increasing. But, as Everyking said, he",0,0,0,0,0,0

The sentence is taken verbatim from the NPR article. However, it links to a Dallas News article, which says no such thing, to a Dallas News interview, which also does not contain this statement, and mentions a WFAA interview, which I've been unable to find. I've checked four different interviews with Ahmed and he does not explicitly describe it as a rebuilt clock in any of them.  If such an interview exists and the statement was not an interpolation by NPR, it would be nice to have a direct link, a quote and a date.  The problem with the statement is that it provides inadequate background for the rest of the article. When the story broke on 9/15, the device was consistently described by the media as """"a homemade clock"""" or """"an invention"""".  The fact that it was a reassembled commercial clock was mentioned in passing by a WFAA article (which quoted Irving police) on 9/16 but otherwise mostly ignored. It only went """"viral"""", so to speak, when Dawkins waded into the controversy on 9/20 and his comments got picked up by the conservative media.  Much of the immediate reaction, from Obama's tweet and Zuckerberg's invitation to Dawkins' lashing out, seems inexplicable if the device in question was acknowledged to be a rebuilt commercial clock from day 1, but makes sense if the device was initially assumed by everyone to be a genuine homemade clock.

If an individual (or his property) is taken into custody in one Department, is there a hearing before a magistrate (as one would expect in a civil code country) before he (or the thing he has an interest in) is extradited to another Department?  I think the main article could be improved by explaining when one Department can exercise jurisdiction over an individual or corporation doing business in the area of a particular Department, and when it is supposed to refrain from exercising that authority.216.99.201.180",0,0,0,0,0,0

89e4491108f6c736,"""  Disruptive editing In my view the collaborative editing team working to make this a FA has shown extreme tolerance in accommodating the concerns of User:Skipsievert. This latest """"tagging"""" follows a full consideration and resolution of COI issues on the appropriate noticeboard. Repeated editing of resolved or previously discussed issues is part of the pattern of disruptive editing. Below is part of the content of the WP entry on disruptive editing:  How disruptive editors evade detection   Disruptive editing already violates site policy, yet certain editors have succeeded in disrupting articles and evading disciplinary action for one of several possible reasons:   their edits occur over a long period of time; in this case, no single edit may be clearly disruptive, but the overall pattern is disruptive  their edits are largely confined to talk-pages, such disruption may not directly harm an article, but it often prevents other editors from reaching consensus on how to improve an article  their edits often avoid gross breaches of civility, especially by refraining from personal attacks, even though they interfere with civil and collaborative editing meant to improve the article  their edits remain limited to a small number of pages that very few people watch  conversely, their edits may be distributed over a wide range of articles that few people watch.   Signs of disruptive editing   This guideline concerns gross, obvious and repeated violations of fundamental policies, not subtle questions about which reasonable people may disagree.  A disruptive editor is an editor who:   Is tendentious: continues editing an article or group of articles in pursuit of a certain point for an extended time despite opposition from one or more other editors. Tendentious editing does not consist only of adding material; some tendentious editors engage in disruptive deletions as well.  Cannot satisfy Wikipedia:Verifiability; fails to cite sources, cites unencyclopedic sources, misrepresents reliable sources, or manufactures original research.  Engages in """"disruptive cite-tagging""""; adds unjustified  tags to an article when the content tagged is already sourced, uses such tags to suggest that properly sourced article content is questionable.  Does not engage in consensus building:  repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits;  repeatedly disregards other editors' explanations for their edits.  Rejects community input: resists moderation and/or requests for comment, continuing to edit in pursuit of a certain point despite an opposing consensus from impartial editors. In addition, such editors may:  Campaign to drive away productive contributors''': act in spite of policies and guidelines such as Wikipedia:Civility, Wikipedia:No personal attacks, Wikipedia:Ownership of articles, engage in sockpuppetry/meatpuppetry, etc. on a low level that might not exhaust the general community's patience, but that operates toward an end of exhausting the patience of productive rules-abiding editors on certain articles.  Refusal to 'get the point'  In some cases, editors have perpetuated disputes by sticking to an allegation or viewpoint long after the consensus of the community has rejected it, repeating it almost without end, and refusing to acknowledge others' input or their own error. Often such editors are continuing to base future attacks and edits upon the rejected statement. Such an action is disruptive to Wikipedia. Thinking one has a valid point does not confer the right to act like it is an accepted rule when it is not.  The editing team has expressed the view that reasonable verified and substantiated requests will be given full consideration. However, IMO the recent spate of """"refusing to get to the point"""", repeated """"tagging"""" total disengagement with """"consensus building"""", """"ignoring of requests for explanations"""", """"ignoring moderator suggestions"""", """"rapid negative engagement with new contributors"""" all spell out the pattern of disruptive editing that has long-delayed completion of this collective effort, and it deserves disciplinary action.

While each of the sources appears reliable enough none of them can be reliably, and verifiability, traced back to either reports written by the people involved with the operation or someone that interviewed them. There does seem to be wide agreement that OBL was hit twice with the first shot being somewhere in the chest/trunk (depending on the report), and the second in the head. There are conflicting reports on the number of shooters and the number of shots fired.   We have a couple of options for the article. 1) Only report those items that seem to have wide agreement and to be silent on those details where our sources offer conflicting data. 2) Document the conflicting details along with the sources. I'd personally go with #1 as it'll be a cleaner article. We'd have a constant battle with people trying to inject a POV such as """"OBL was shot twice by one person - look at all these sources.""""   I have a personal concern with the New Yorker version of the events in that it mentions the assault team blowing their way through doors and walls. For the first couple of days after the mission it appeared the public was allowed to wander around the compound and were only restricted from the innermost courtyard. Lots of people took photos. I never saw a photo of a hole blown into a wall nor did I see any apparent damage to the doors. Visible evidence of the assault would have been of great interest and no one took a photo? Thus, I'd say the New Yorker and other articles article is wrong on that detail. The assault team likely found the inner doors were unlocked and/or scaled the walls to get into the compound and to move between the walled off sections of the compound.   There are other concerns about the New Yorker article in that it switches from great detail which appears to build credibility and the impression that this is an """"inside account"""" to an absence of information on basic things such as what team #1 was doing immediately after they landed. I suspect the entire thing was spun together out of speculative opinions by others. Unfortunately, many of the articles about this incident have similar issues. |talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am not sure what the Shirra has to do with this. Surely it's documentary, graphic, archaeological etc evidence that counts, not the unreferenced thoughts of the early 19th century Scotland's answer to Jeffrey Archer.  Though in one respect you are quite right. The article is incomplete - there is no reference to F  J Grant's little book - Islay is on p 11 of gthe 1914 edition - available as a pdf download online.  """"The Scottish officers of arms formed an important part of the Royal Household, and were in attendance on the King on all occasions of state. Besides the duties enumerated above, they were employed in accompanying embassies abroad, making royal proclamation throughout the country, carrying important messages of state between the King and his subjects, and a summons for treason could only be served by a herald or pursuivant. As early as 1364 mention is made of William Pittolloch, Herald; and in 1365, in the Great Seal Register, of John Trupour, Carrick Herald (probably a mistake for pursuivant). Lyon Herald appears in 1377, and ten years later as Lyon King of Heralds. Rothesay Herald, officer of the Prince of Scotland, is first mentioned in 1401: Marchmont, a title derived from Marchmont, the ancient name of the Royal Castle of Roxburgh, in 1436 ; Snowdoun, derived from a part of Stirhng Castle, in 1448; Albany, from the Duke of Albany, a title of one of the King's sons, in 145 1 (he is called pursuivant, however, in 1447); Ross, from the Royal Earldom of the same, in 1474; and tslay, from the island of that name, in 1493. Other heralds are also found from time to time, such as Ireland in 1498 and Orkney in 1581. Of the pursuivants, Carrick, Pursuivant of the Prince, who was Earl of Carrick, appears first in the year 1365 ; Unicorn in 1426; Aliszaiin 1426; Dragancein 1429; Diligence in 1472; Dingwall in 1479; Montrose, Bute and Ormond in 1488; Falkland in 1493; Ireland and Kintyre in 1495 '> March in 1515 ; and Ettrick, """"pretendit pursuivant,"""" in 157 1. The number of heralds and pursuivants became fixed at The Heraldic Executive six of each by the reign of King James VI., and continued at this number till by the Act of 1867 their numbers were gradually reduced to three of each as vacancies occurred. The titles now [at the time of writing] in use are Ross, Rothesay, and Albany for the heralds; and March, Unicorn, and Carrick for the pursuivants"""".  FRANCIS J. GRANT, W.S.

My point is that in the system used here, an fheall is transcribed with  (= conventional [n']) or  (= conventional [N']), while a ngeall is transcribed with  (= conventional [Å']), just as geall is transcribed with  (= conventional [g']), gheall with [j] or  (= conventional , ceann with [c] (= conventional [k']), and cheann with [Ã§] (= conventional [x']). Basically, the entire palatal series of IPA is used for the Irish """"slender velars""""; the article uses  rather than  for conventional [L'] for precisely this reason. I don't know whether /x/ is velar or uvular for most speakers, but I do know that all the sources I checked call it velar, so that's what the article says.

748850229690e3d3,"""  Actually, I am pretty sure for example Maris Verpakovskis real name is like that, because """"Maris"""" is even Latvian name. At least here in Lithuanian there are both Russians who uses their names as they'd use in Russia and who uses lituanised versions (with endings """"as"""" or """"is""""). Out of Russians who uses lituanised names, many are second or third generation; sometimes parents decides to give children lituanised version of name and surname in those cases, it happens especially in mixed families. E.g. one of Lithuanian football team players is Igoris Morinas; it would be wrong to change it to Igor Morin because Igoris Morinas is his real name. While, for example, real name of the mentioned poolitician is Viktor Uspaskich, not Viktoras Uspaskichas, therefore Viktor Uspaskich is and should be used (and is used that way in Lithuanian wikipedia too). As for Latvian football team, I am not really sure though, but I am sure that for example Verpakovskis is not Mariy Verpakovskiy or something. Maybe someone could shed more light on Latvian policy on names, maybe in Latvia it is different than here in Lithuania, or maybe Latvianisation of name is for example required to get citizenship?

79a17298bd3f5584,"""  Daniel 9:24-27 Daniel tells of the comming of the messiah Jesus. This was a prophecy and the Magi or wise men read the prophecy and identified the Mesiah well in advance. This proves that for men of faith prophecy is fact not mere speculation. Jesus told Thomas, """"more blessed is he that belives without first seeing"""". I have posted an article by Pastor David Bay for you to read which explains in detail the prophecy of Jesus's comming.  THE UNPARALLELED PRECISE PROPHECY  Daniel 9:24-26, """"Seventy weeks of years, or 490 years are decreed upon your people and upon your holy city Jerusalem, to finish and put an end to transgression, to seal up and make full the measure of sin, to purge away and make expiation and reconciliation for sin, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint a holy of holies. Know, therefore, and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem until the coming of the anointed one, a prince, shall be seven weeks of years, and sixty-two weeks of years; it shall be built again with city square and moat, but in troublous times. And after the 62 weeks of years, shall the anointed one be cut off (killed) and shall have nothing and no one belonging to and defending Him...""""  The remaining one week is found in verse 27, and refers to the last seven years of earth's history, the period which we know as the """"Great Tribulation"""".  The term """"Weeks of Years"""" was a common Jewish term. It meant literally seven (7) years. The term comes from God's commandment in Leviticus 25:3-4 to farm a piece of land for only six years, allowing it to lie fallow for the seventh. This seven-year period came to be known as a """"week of years"""". Therefore, Seventy Weeks of Years was 490 Hebrew years.  Note this prophecy contains three parts:      1. 7 Weeks of Years (49 Hebrew Years)      2. 62 Weeks of Years (434 Hebrew Years)      3. 1 Week of Years (7 Hebrew Years)  At the precise point in history when the 7 + 62 Weeks of Years occurred, Israel could expect Messiah to announce Himself as Messiah. What great news! This means that Israel could not miss Messiah. All they had to do was to count, be cognizant of current events in Israel as they unfolded, and be aware of this prophecy.  This study will show us several things:      1. Why the Wise Men knew the time for Messiah was close.      2. Why Israel missed Messiah.      3. How this applies to us today.  Let us now consider the meaning of the prophecy.  I. The Duration of the Prophecy  This prophecy stipulated that Messiah would be presented to Israel and would be killed after 69 weeks of years had elapsed from the specified starting point. When we multiply 69 times 7, we understand that the time involved here equals 483 Jewish years. Since the Jewish calendar contains 360 days, we can easily see that God is talking about 173,880 days. Therefore, we can expect that 173,880 days after the prophecy started, the Messiah would present Himself to Israel as Messiah-King.  II. The Starting Point of the Prophecy (Daniel 9:25a)  In this verse , God said the prophecy would begin """"from the going forth (the issuing) of the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem..."""" At the time God gave Daniel this prophecy, Israel was a slave nation under Babylon; however, God had foretold that this slavery would last only 70 years. This 70-year period was rapidly coming to a close; indeed, non-Jewish history records that the Medo-Persian emperor Artaxerxes issued such a decree on March 14, 445 B.C. Therefore, precisely 173,880 days from this day should bring us to some significant event in Jesus' life which presented Him to the nation Israel as Messiah.  III. The Mathematics Of The Prophecy  A. The First Seven Weeks (49 Jewish Years)  If you study the book of Nehemiah, you will find the account of the Jewish pilgrimage to rebuild Jerusalem following King Artaxerxes' decree. The prophet Nehemiah assumed charge of this rebuilding effort, which was carried out in such extreme hardship and danger that the builders carried swords with them as they were building the walls. Thus was fulfilled precisely the prophecy in verse 25b,""""...it shall be built again with city square and moat, but in troublous times.""""  This effort began in 445 B.C. and culminated in 396 B.C., exactly 49 years, just as foretold.  B. The Second Period (62 Weeks of Years, 434 years)  Daniel 9:26 foretells that the """"anointed One"""" would come after this period and would then be killed. This wording is understood by most conservative scholars to refer to Jesus Christ, not at His birth, but at His presentation as the Messiah-Prince. (2) """"",0,0,0,0,0,0

When I looked at a bunch of the sources about a month ago (2015-02-14), for most of the far future launches, the most one could say is that they were """"under contract""""; while some of the very near term future launches (one to three ahead in the queue) were both clearly """"scheduled"""" and also scheduled with the particular local and national authorities to make the near term date have some meaning.

Not even Encyclopaedia Britannica (your favourite source) mentions their ethnic background: .   What's important is that the dynasty was started by a former slave, and that it rose out of the chaos that followed Seljuqid decline in Central Asia. It's absolutely unimportant whether Anushtigin was a Turk, a Mongol, a Chinese, or a Brazilian, because his descendants ruled as the """"Shahs of Khorezm"""" and not as the """"Turkic rulers of Turkistan"""". If someone is interested in Anushtigin's background, he can click on the link. The dynasty was certainly not """"Turkic"""", as you claim (and this is indeed bad faith), but only the dynasty's founder was (most likely) of Qipchaq origin.   In the article Mughals we agreed not to mention any ethnic lables, because the Mongolian origin of the dynasy's founder has no importance - the Mughals came from a Mongol background, but they were not Mongol rulers (in contrast to their Gengghizid ancestors).   I do not dispute authoritative sources, such as Iranica, who describe Anushtigin as a Turk. That'S why I have modified the Anush Tigin Gharchai article.

12a39a1f3df7e13f,"""  To Cool Hand Luke: I ask for your help as an administrator with this problem.   From the Wikipedia deletion guidelines:  Deletion process      Main article: Wikipedia:Deletion policy  Deletion of articles from Wikipedia occurs through one of three processes.       2. Another quick method is the use of proposed deletion: simply add   to the top of the article. This is meant for articles where the deletion is believed to be uncontroversial, yet does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion. A proposed deletion can be contested by any user by removing the  tag within five days, and if anyone still wants the article deleted the full AFD process is required.  I thought I complied with this policy, it seems to say that """"any user"""" can """"contest"""" the proposal by """"removing"""" the tag. It seems obvious that this article easily meets the criteria for notabilitythe stated reason for deletion. Beyond meeting the criteria's specifics, the criteria also has a catchall inclusion rule that the mere fact that an article does not meet specific criteria is not a sufficient reason to delete it.  I believe that the proposal to delete this article was made in retaliation against me personally and was not made in good faith to further the goals of Wikipedia, and that the proposal to delete, along with the reasons given, which I believe are not in good faith, therefore violates various Wikipedia policies.  The evidence for this belief includes (1) the proximity in time to an unrelated disagreement with the user proposing deletion; (2) the user's prior lack of interest or contribution or current knowledge of (as demonstrated by his reasons or comments) to the subject of the article proposed for deletion; (3) the fact that I have worked on this article in the past; (4) the fact that this user on or about the same day and time, in close proximity to the unrelated dispute with me, proposed two other articles that I have worked on that the user also has not previously or currently demonstrated any knowledge of or interest in; (5) proposed such articles for speedy deletion and then before I or anyone else had a chance to object (Wikipedia is not a full time job for most users, who only visit the site from time to time, and note also the stated policy that there are """"no emergencies on Wikipedia,"""" the user decided not to wait for any objections or to follow the policy of allowing the stated time period to pass, redirected the article to another article, effectively deleting the original article.

The first paragraph from Statistical model#General remarks is relevant here, and is copied below. A statistical model is a special type of mathematical model. What distinguishes a statistical model from other mathematical models is that a statistical model is non-deterministic. Thus, in a statistical model specified via mathematical equations, some of the variables do not have specific values, but instead have probability distributions; i.e. some of the variables are stochastic.  In the equations of a grey box model, is it required that there be stochastic variables? I think that the article would benefit from making that clear.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

But it seems wiki process has other rules. And even if there are rules, the rules are worthless, as you've apparently stated above.    Re your: If you've already supplied page numbers and are saying they weren't received appropriately, please supply diffs of your edits with the citations, and of the responses that you're taking issue with.

REFS: Christopher Simpson, Blowback: America's Recruitment of Nazis and Its Effects on the Cold War, London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson 1988, pp.42, 44 ISBN 1555841066; Richard Harris Smith, OSS: Secret history of the CIA, Berkeley: University of California Press 1972, p.240 ISBN 0440567351 OUTCOME: Quietly dropped from New Aftermath section. Finished. Kaput. Even though there was no consensual agreement to do so. In fact, consensus seemed to support inclusion of this topic.

The image could be used in the treatment subsection (where I originally placed it) or somewhere else in the article, but the top image should be as singularly """"cystic fibrosis"""" as the title itself. For diseases like, off the top of my head, lupus, clubfoot, ALS, spina bifida, or Downs syndrome, images of people could be very suitable for the lede. But for other diseases, a picture of a person suffering from the disease really doesn't work - a person with a runny nose could have the flu, or could just have allergies. There's nothing so strikingly visual about how the flu manifests itself in a human being that justifies a picture of a person with the flu in the lede when a picture of the bug itself can be used. Same with Tay-Sachs, or Alzheimers, or AIDS - none of these articles have a picture of a human being in their lede, and for good reason. It's an article about cystic fibrosis, not """"living with"""" cystic fibrosis, and as such, we should strive to present readers with an image that's as singularly CF as possible. The image of the girl is cute and touching and is suitable enough for the """"treatment"""" section, but is unfitting of being the lead image in the article.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

In the Old Style dating, the year began on 25 March, whereas in the New Style it began on 1 January.Death warrant of Charles I web page of the UK National Archives A demonstration of New Style meaning Julian calendar with a start of year adjustment.

15436b7716d074db,"""  Mentioning Darwin gave up natural selection and became a Lamarckian  The article currently makes no mention of the historically important fact that Darwin himself converted from the natural selection theory of evolution to a Lamarckian environmentalist position in later editions of The Origin of Species, which went into 6 different editions by 1872. Hence I propose the following insert at the first Darwin quotation in the current section âPublication of the theory of natural selectionâ, which I also propose should be retitled âPublication of the Darwinâs theory of evolutionâ.  Proposed insert:  'However,  even in the first edition of his book Darwin only claimed natural selection was the main means of selection, but not the only one. In the last sentence of its Introduction he said âFurthermore, I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.â  But by 1872 he had published six editions of the book with corrections and revisions, and in later editions in response to criticism of his theory of inheritance Darwin even gave up the theory of natural selection as the main selector of evolution, with its strong principle of inheritance, in favour of Lamarckian environmentalism, with a changing environment as the main selector. As C.D. Darlington wrote in 1950 in his Foreword to a new and first reprint of the otherwise unavailable first edition of The Origin:  """"Let no one imagine, however, that, in the world of science, Darwin's theory has enjoyed an unchequered prosperity. On the contrary the dust of battle is only now beginning to settle on the hotly disputed ground....The most abiding source of trouble was that discovered  by the Professor of Engineering at Edinburgh. Professor Fleming[sic] Jenkin pointed out in 1867, that any new variation appearing in one individual would be lost or swamped in later generations when that individual was compelled to cross with others of the old and established type, and its differences, as Darwin believed, blended in inheritance. Nature would never be able to keep any differences to select.   Darwin's defence against this objection was already prepared. He had hinted it in the first edition of The Origin of Species: at the end of the Introduction he had said that """"Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification."""" In later editions he hedged further. He fell  back on the other means. These depended chiefly on the action of a changing environment: its direct effect in altering living things so as to suit it must be inherited. In adopting this view Darwin was giving up his own, and Wallace's, peculiar claim to originality: he was giving up the argument implied in the title of the book: and he was falling back on the discarded and disreputable theory of Lamarck.""""  [p. xvii On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection first edition reprint in The Thinker's Library by Watts & Co, 1950.] '  But Darlington failed to establish Lamarck's theory was discarded or disreputable. In fact the theory of natural selection only became accepted in the mid-20th century with the âMendelian-Darwinian synthesisâ in population genetics. But even by 1950 Darwinism was still not accepted in academia according to Darlington:  """"In view of the triumph of his ideas it might be thought that Darwinism, in all civilised countries, would be taught as one of the foundations of thought, that in the universities everywhere it would be critically expounded and experimentally developed. That is true of its remote and general applications to such sciences as astronomy and geology. But where, as in its applications to ourselves, in the study of the genetics of men, and to the histories of nations, as exact knowledge of the principles of variation, hybridization and selection is required, we hear on every side nothing but confused and ignorant speculations. At the same time the foundation of Darwinism in the experimental study of evolution has largely been smothered in Darwin's own country. The Universities, with their museums and botanic gardens, are happy to forget what, in 1859, they were unable to resist. They contain no memorial of his work,  and all the means of developing his doctrine they frustrate by an arrangement of teaching which the theory of evolution is not allowed to disturb. The old pedantic learning of botany and zoology, which Darwin treated as one subject, they continue to cleave asunder, burying the halves under their ancient schedules of instruction.""""

4556ccaec00ec906,""" __TOC__  Totoro and Shinto I don't believe the section """"Totoro and Shinto"""" is necessary. Totoro has nothing to do with anything religious. Even though there appears shrines and a tree with a shimenawa, it doesn't mean that Totoro has shintoist themes because you can see shinto shrine everywhere in Japan. Regarding appearance of shrine as Shintoism is just a misunderstanding by foreigners who have little knowledge of the Japanese way of religion. Obake has nothing to do with shinto either. No Japanese people regard obake as a part of shinto. If you call Totoro religious, almost all Japanese anime and manga will be religious. Do you call Inuyasha religious just because Kagome lives in a shrine? Or do you call Yu Yu Hakusho religious because Yusuke became a ghost and there're many yokais in the show? Or do you say Shrek has Christian themes just because there's a church? Calling something shintoism just because it is traditional is nonsense. Even if Totoro seems to have shintoist themes to the westerners' eyes, it just means Totoro is a movie set in the Japanese countryside and it is nothing worthy of special mention.    You may believe most Japanese people are shintoist, but it is not necessarily true. They go to shrine on New Year's Day not because they believe in shinto but simply beacuse it is Japanese tradition. The same thing can be said about the appearance of the shrine in Totoro. The appearance of shinto shrine or that of obake cannot be connected to shinto. Believe it or not, it is true that there's no Japanese word for """"shintoist"""" although there is the word for """"Buddhist"""", bukkyouto. In other words, Japanese people don't regard them something like """"shintoist"""". To Japanese, shinto is not something you believe in or you don't blieve in. There's no bible or dogma. Shinto is nothing like Christianity, Islam or Buddhism. It is even doubtful whether it is proper to say that shinto is a religion.  Totoro is nothing religious. Repeat, the appearance of the shrine doesn't mean Totoro has shintoist themes. I must say that to see Totoro religious is only a biased viewpoint. If there're no dissenting opinions, I will erase the section """"Totoro and Shinto"""" on the 24 of April, a week after my first note on the issue.    True, Totoro is not religious, but there are significant Shinto themes throughout the film. The Totoro are forest/nature spirits, the tree where they live is part of a shrine, and so on. Having Shinto themes does not mean Miyazaki was trying to get across some religious point. Rather, I imagine he was trying to evoke images of a lost past (as it is set in the 1950s) when things were simpler, and trying to get people to remember their roots and not forget their traditions. As you wrote yourself, Shinto is not so much a religion anymore (except to a very few), but more of a set of traditions with some religious elements. Totoro can have Shinto elements without being a religious film. I don't think anyone is arguing the film is religious. You're the only one who's said anything about that. I do find it odd how you reply to yourself above, and appear to be arguing with yourself.Â·Â·Â·? Â· Talk to Nihonjoe   No, I didn't talk to myself. I wanted to say some more. That's all.

Many of these may be already on this talk page, it's just some people choose to ignore them and uphold their own POV:   The establishment of the Gajar capital in Tehran at the end of the eighteenth century was merely the last manifestation of what may well be a permanent tendency in the life of Iran. There are manifold reason of this phenomenon. Moreover, the Turkish and Mongol origins of the earliest dynasties certainly played a major part in causing the capitals to be situated in the north, and especially along the main invasion route following Alburz into Azarbaijan. The princes of these basically nomadic states were anxious both to be near their tribes and to avoid the excessive heat of the climate farther to the south. This helps to explain the evolution of Tabriz, which, despite all the vicissitudes, was the capital successively of the Mongols, the Qara Qoyunlu, the Aq Qoyunlu, and finally the Safavids, all of whom stemmed originally from the Turkmen tribes of the north-west from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries. Tabriz was abandoned only for short periods, and always for other cities in the same region: Maragheh, whose, fertile pasture land had attracted Hulagu, Ardabil, the cradle of the Safavids; and Sultaniyeh.   The Cambridge History of Iran (in eight Volumes). Volume 1. The Land of Iran. Edited by W.B.Fisher, Cambridge at the University Press, 1968. Page 434.    The origins of the Safavids are clouded in obscurity. They may have been of Kurdish origin (see R. Savory, Iran Under the Safavids, 1980, p. 2; R. Matthee, """"Safavid Dynasty"""" at iranica.com ), but for all practical purposes they were Turkish-speaking and Turkified. Their eponymous ancestor, Safi-al-Din (1252-1334), was a disciple of Shaikh Zahed of Gilan, a Sunnite Sufi pir or spiritual leader. Safi-al-Din succeeded his pir and settled in Ardabil in eastern Azerbaijan, and founded the Safavid Order. He was buried there, and his tomb and the citybecame a place of pilgrimage for his devotees. In the course of time and under the leadership of Safi-al-Din's descendents, the order became a militant Shiite one, with golat or extremist features, receiving support from Turkish and Turkmen tribes in Azerbaijan and eastern Anatolia, such as the Shamlu, Ostajlu, Takallu, DÂ¨u'l-Qadr, Qajar, and Afshar tribes, who had strong devotional ties to the heads of the Order.    The oldest poet of Azeri literature known so far (and indubitably of Azeri, not East Anatolian or Khorasani, origin) is Emad-al-din Nasimi (about 1369 â 1404, q.v.). Other important Azeri poets were Shah Esma'il Safawi """"Khata'i"""" (1487 â 1524) and Fozuli (about 1494 â 1556,q.v.), an outstanding Azeri poet. During 17th â 20th centuries a rich Azeri literature continued to flourish, but classical Persian exercised great influence on the language and literary expression. On the other hand, many Azeri words (about 1.200) entered Persian (still more in Kurdish), since Iran was governed mostly by Azeri-speaking rulers and soldiers since 16th century (Doerfer, 1963-75); these loanwords refer mainly to administration, titles and conduct of war.     Shah Abbas II (r. 1052 â 77/ 1642 â 66 q.v.) was himself a poet, writing Turkic verse with the pen name of Tani.     The Zands were an Iranian people, and their decades of dominance were one of the few periods, between the arrival of the SaljÅ«qs and the twentieth century, during which effective political power was exercised by a dynasty that can be regarded as in some sense ethnically """"Persian"""".    David Morgan. Medieval Persia, 1040-1797 (History of the Near East) ISBN: 0582493242   With the exception of some very local dynasties, the Zands were the only Iranian dynasty that had come to power since the Buyids in the 10th century.    The Azeri Turks are Shiites and were founders of the Safavid dynasty.   Thanks.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Furthermore, Ruslik0 is incorrect that I made a false accusation regarding the objective fact that Jeffro77 is engaging in vandalism: Jeffro77 replaced this entrywhich is very similar to the version that existed there since October 31, 2008, with some improvementswith this entry, giving the excuse in his edit summary of """"WP:FRINGE,"""" which doesn't even make sense as an explanation for his edits: i.e., deletion of a number of citations; deletion of the information on theologian Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg's defense of the theology of the Omega Point Theory; etc. As well, there's no need for the large displayed quote, as the previous entry already stated that Prof. David Deutsch doesn't agree that the Omega Point is God; furthermore, Jeffro77's edit deletes the mention of the fact that Prof. Deutsch endorses the physics of the Omega Point Theory.  In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""".

Extracts from Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.""""  As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.  Additionally, while Jeffro77's """"fringe"""" claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.  As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, """"The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,"""" Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals).

9f163747e5cac904,"(UTC) The 2008 ratification of The Great Lakes Commission finally commits American and Canadian governments to the geographical definition of the North American Great Lakes as a distinctive political entity.  In fact and operation, the complex cooperative management of The Great Lakes for purposes of trade, border discipline, parks, transportation, hydro-power, water management and environmental protection has been a reality since 1815.   Ethnically and economically, the borders have always been porous.   Politically, the region has more bi-national commonalities than generally supposed.    Much of Ontarian political culture derived from both Anglo-American heritage and the simultaneous influence and threat of American examples.   More importantly, both the American and Canadian sides played analogous roles in the world-economy.   Both sides of the border transformed from peripheries that supplied natural resources; to semi-peripheries that performed middle-man brokerage functions; to core regions, represented by such world cities as Chicago and Toronto, that provided hubs of capital, administration, and management.   History, politics, culture, and ethnic composition, as well as the more obvious economy, technology, and geology, define Ontario and American Great Lakes states as one region.  04:11, 27 January 2009",0,0,0,0,0,0

I think it's fine to rationalise the arrangement on these topics, however I have some reservations about the latter of these two articles. It was one of a brace of Aztec and Maya articles (see for eg Mayan Trade, Mayan Food) all created around the same time in September by about 4 or 5 first-time editors, and they all have the hallmark of coming from some more extensive essay on the subject area. I'm not saying that there's copyvio involved here, my guess would be that it's almost like some joint class assignment has been broken up into separate articles. They are based on reasonable material, but they contain a number of evident misinterpretations and have more of a school essay feel to them. They need considerable work and rearranging, and in some instances I really wonder whether it is worth the effort as they cut across topics already covered in the main Aztec/Maya articles.  Just so as you know and something to bear in mind if distributing their contents across other articles. The images which came with the Daily Life article are also I believe mis-tagged as the contributor's own work, when clearly they seem to be taken from elsewhere.

fc5543da8c0e0e16,"Attempt of translation of (French) Magneto-Explosive Generator page   Talk:Explosively Pumped Flux Compression Generators/Translation from french page  Explosively pumped flux compression generators generate high power electrical pulses by compressing magnetic flux using explosives.  The first work on these generators was conducted by the VNIIEF centre for nuclear research in Sarov at the beginning of the 1950's, and then, independently, by LANL in the USA.   History   At the start of the 1950's, the need for very short and powerful electrical pulses became evident to Soviet scientists  conducting nuclear fusion research. At that point in time, the Marx generator, which stores energy in capacitors, was the only device capable of producing such high power pulses. The prohibitive cost of the capacitors required to obtain the desired power motivated the search for a more economical device. The first Magneto-explosive generators, which followed from the ideas of AndreÃ¯ Sakharov, were designed to fill this role.     Principles of Function    ''In the following text, we will use terms like 'compression' or 'confinement' of the magnetic field. Because of the similarity between certain properties of gases and magnetic fields, the conventional use of these terms can be extended by analogy to magnetic fields. Various uses of this similarity can be found in this article by J.-P. Petit..  Magneto-explosive generator use a technique called 'magentic flux compression', which will be described in detail later. The technique is made possible when the timescales over which the device operates are sufficiently brief that resistive current loss  is negligible, and the magnetic flux on any surface surrounded by a conductor (copper wire, for example) remains constant, even though the size and shape of the surface may change.   This flux conservation can be demonstrated from Maxwell's equations. The most intuitive explanation of this conservation of enclosed flux follows from the principle that any change in an electromagnetic system provokes an effect in order to oppose the change. For this reason, reducing the area of the surface enclosed by a conductor, which would reduce the magnetic flux, results in the induction of current in the electrical conductor, which tends to return the enclosed flux to its original value. In magneto-explosive generators, this phenomenon is obtained by various techniques which depend on powerful explosives.  Other techniques exist which do not depend on  explosives. Notably, see Â : Flux compression scheme used at the Gramat centre of study, in doctoral thesis, Mathias Bavay, 8 july 2002.  The compression process allows the chemical energy of the explosives to be (partially) transformed into electrical energy, using the magnetic flux as an intermediary agent of energy storage. (Note that I didn't like the catalyser argument: the magnetic field is highly dynamic, and in a sense consumes the reactant (the initial kinetic energy), even though the flux is conserved, unlike most chemical catalysts, which act mostly just to bring together the reactants in the correct configuration. A closer chemical analysis would be something like electron transport in photosynthesis, perhaps, but that really doesn't add anything useful to the discussion).    Elementary description of flux compression   An external magnetic field (blue lines) thread a closed ring made of a perfect conductor (with zero resistivity). The nine field lines represent the magnetic flux threading the ring.  After the ring's diameter is reduced, the magnetic flux threading the ring, represented by five field lines, is reduced by the same ratio as the area of the ring. The variation of the magnetic flux induces a current in the ring (red arrows), which in turn creates a new magnetic field, so that the total flux in the interior of the ring is maintained (four green field lines added to the five blue lines give the original nine field lines).   By adding together the external magnetic field and the induced field,",0,0,0,0,0,0

5a7b833082e3fa3f,"As Roland perceptively noted, Sand's book is not so much propositive of a theory, as deconstructive of theories about a people. The most invaluable part of the book consists of a perfectly normal historian's history, i.e., of the socio-ideological forces influencing the construction of a modern collective Jewish identity. In this I am reminded of Martin Bernal. His propositive theory, which however took up far more space than Sand dedicates to the Khazars, was almost self-evidently silly. But his analysis in volume 1 of the modern historiography of ancient Greece as that was influenced by racial theory, is still regarded as a tour de force. One doesn't throw the baby out with the barfwater. As to genetics, Sand himself deals with that pp.273ff., and in so far as RS reviews challenge him on this, they cannot be excluded, even if, it's just a personal view, many of those reviews are incompetent and show a lack of familiarity with the book. The criterion should be, genetic criticism or evaluation of Sand should be admitted if Sand's book is specifically targeted or mentioned by those papers, and ignored if not.

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors âfansâ to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they donât approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete """"when in doubt don't delete"""" and not to show respect when communicating.

From August to December, 1945, Poles expelled close to 600,000 more Germans in poorly organized transports.â  âThe final phase involved the transfer of 2.25 million Germans in a process coordinated with British and Soviet authorities in occupied Germany in 1946 and 1947.â """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would say that this is an important piece of criticism on Ashbery, to the extent that those who consider themselves to be working outside the industry (oddly, this includes many university professors) have come to view Ashbery as something less than the real thing, or that he became part of the established industry because he was not a true innovator.

3ebe2a384da4e8bc,"""   Not impressed by the generic explanation when you removed my link twice.   Walter,   I see that you are a fellow Christian and a fellow Christian musician, although being 12 years younger than I, it's not likely that you lived through the early days of the """"Jesus Movement"""" as I did.    As a longtime Web Site content developer, K-12 Textbook editor, English Professor, Bible teacher, Music teacher, professional writer, and a one-time """"Jesus Musician,"""" I've recently started a project (SchoolOfTheRock.com) to help disciple the 18-15-year olds I minister to regularly on issues of contemporary Christian living, especially in areas related to worship and Bible teaching.  Despite an ad here or there on the site to help pay a fraction of the site's expenses, you'd be hard-pressed to call it a commercial endeavor. (I pay the site's manifold expenses as a """"write-off"""" from my professional consulting business.)    Because I grew up with people who hate Contemporary Christian music (and still run into them from time to time), I thought it would be nice to include articles that show some of the ways in which Biblical living, and Biblical worship through contemporary musical forms tie together.    To find links I could include from my pages, I went looking for any internet articles that provided insightful, balanced, detailed, and fact-based accounts of the history of Contemporary Christian music.  I didn't find any that fulfilled all of those qualificatiosn.  Your Wikipedia summary IS useful, and is a good introduction, VERY appropriate for Wikipedia, but I wanted something that presented more details and presented them in a stronger narrative that showed the history of Christian music from the musician's perspective.    So I wrote an fact-based, detailed, well-organized article that included, not only the history of the industry, but also personal experiences as well as the experiences of friends who were either touring artists or industry professionals.   You might be put off by a couple of paragraphs in first person, but if you've ever read Paul Baker's books, you'll find all the proof you need that it's an accurate history, even to the minor details.  Or maybe you're put off by some of the """"negative"""" statements about dark times in the history of Christian music.  But the sources you cite and books you recommend have sections that are FAR more negative.  Also, I carefully chose details that would get the point across with inspiring the reader to outrage on certain topics, as a fully-detailed account would have done.  I've also """"vetted"""" the article for content, balance, and tone by running it past former touring artists and Christian broadcasting professionals who lived through the same era. I have gotten nothing but enthusiastic response.    If you can find another Internet-published article (or ten) on the same subject that is as well written, organized, balanced, and fact-based as my article, please let me know.  I'd be VERY glad to link to them from my web site.  I'd also like to know why you don't link to those articles from the Wiki article?  If they exist, that is.  Finally, I confess that I am at a loss as to why you consider my article either to be a """"commercial advertisement"""" or a """"personal blog"""" (both accusations came through the message to me, though it was largely """"boilerplate,"""" so I'm not sure which part was really yours).  I recognize that is is NOT a Wikipedia article, but it is a fact-based, detailed, and hopefully balanced article nonetheless, far more so than quite a few other article links I see on similar Wikipedia pages. It is not advertising any specific product, or even any commercial web site.  BTW CCM magazine is commercial - they cost money to subscribe to and have LOADS of advertising.  Why do you have THEIR link, if you are seeking to avoid even the appearance of supportiing a commercial enterprise.  Also, the article dos NOT contain unverifiable personal ramblings or rants, as a blog would.  (I publish blogs in other web sites so I know the difference.)   Perhaps you object to the fact that I posted the link myself.  Would it be a better article if I asked an industry contact to post the link?  Or maybe you should read the article yourself and let me know specifically what you feel is unsuitable about it?  If you've lost the link, it's at:  http://www.schooloftherock.com/html/a_brief_history_of_contemporar.html  Frankly, I'm hoping that as a fellow musician you find the article edifying, exhorting, and comforting.  And if you ARE aware of anything """"wrong"""" with it on any level, please let me know, because I strive for proessionalism.
