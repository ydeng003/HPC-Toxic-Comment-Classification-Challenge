Welcome to Toxic Comment Classification Challenge!

This project build 3 multi-headed models thatâ€™s capable of detecting different types of toxicity. 

Running the System

2. Upload all source code files and input data files(either sample input file or whole input file) into the project directory.

3. Run the "tfidf.sh" shell script.

4. Run "s1.sh" / "s2.sh" / "s3.sh" for each strategy.

5. To check the prediction of each strategy, go to folder "strategy1_output" / "strategy2_output" / "strategy3_output" to see the prediction of each label after the application has successfully completed.

6. To see the accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and time efficiency for each model, check log file for each run.
